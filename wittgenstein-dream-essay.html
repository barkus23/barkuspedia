    <div class="meta">july 2025 · philosophy of mind · ~2,700 words</div>

    <div class="abstract">
        <p>In this essay, I critically analyse Wittgenstein's remarks by revealing his reformulation of the debate
            surrounding dreams as events in sleep. I commend Wittgenstein's refining approach as he exposes an illusion
            that has misled philosophers. My conclusion is that Wittgenstein does not hold a position on whether dreams
            are events that occurred in sleep. His quest is to provide therapy to the philosophers caught in an
            illusion. The Malcolm-Putnam debate provides a framework to capture Wittgenstein's critical approach. While
            some may read his critical approach as an implicit view denying that dreams are events in sleep, I
            deconstruct this objection as a misreading of his approach.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. wittgenstein's therapeutic reformulation</h2>

    <p>Wittgenstein's remarks present a unique reformulation to the philosophical debate surrounding dreams. Traditional
        questions like <span class="quote">"Are dream events in sleep"</span> are not merely misguided for Wittgenstein.
        These questions are grammatical illusions born of language's <span class="quote">"bewitchment of our
            understanding"</span> <span class="citation">(1953, Part I §109)</span>. His task as a philosophical
        therapist is to dissolve these pseudo-problems by returning <span class="concept">"dream"</span> to its ordinary
        usage in language games.</p>

    <p>This reformulation begins in Wittgenstein's framing of dreams as a distinct language game. A language game is a
        <span class="quote">"whole consisting, of language and the activities into which it is woven"</span> <span
            class="citation">(1953, Part I §7)</span>. The dream language game is inaugurated by teaching the expression
        <span class="concept">"I dreamt"</span>, for Wittgenstein remarks that <span class="quote">"People who on waking
            tell us certain incidents… Then we teach them the expression 'I dreamt', which is followed by the
            narrative"</span> <span class="citation">(1953, Part II VII)</span>. Crucially, the expression is not a
        report of hidden events in sleep but an <span class="emphasis">avowal</span>. As an avowal it differs from a
        report, avowals are first-person expressions of internal states. Here Wittgenstein has set the structure to
        where his therapeutic process begins.
    </p>

    <p>Dreams as avowals are bound by their own distinct language game. When Wittgenstein asks <span class="quote">"Has
            the verb 'to dream' a present tense? How does a person learn it?"</span> <span class="citation">(1967,
            §399)</span>, he reveals a significant outlier in the dream's language game. While verbs like "see" and
        "hear" have present-tense usability, "dream" does not. The expression "I dreamt" resembles a past tense report,
        revealing the illusion that dreams are events occurring during sleep. The revealing of this asymmetry in the
        grammar of dreams compared to other avowals represents an innovation of the therapeutic approach. Through
        producing a <span class="concept">"surveyability"</span> (<em>Übersichtlichkeit</em>), the method of mapping
        language-games to dissolve confusion. It becomes clearer that philosophers often project their own grammatical
        perceptions onto dreams rather than mapping out the grammar of dreams itself. This dissolving via surveyability,
        resolves the misunderstanding that the grammar of dreams reveals them to be events in sleep.</p>

    <p>This clarification is not enough to argue that Wittgenstein denies dreams as events that occurred in sleep. He
        expresses caution in making conclusions as to what dreams are in the given that <span class="quote">"an
            assumption about whether these people are deceived by their memories or not, whether they really had such
            images while they slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking?"</span> will be dependent upon
        <span class="quote">"how the question is used"</span> <span class="citation">(1953, Part II VII)</span>. Here
        Wittgenstein sets out a crucial redirection in the dreams debate.
    </p>

    <p class="note">[note: here wittgenstein references the famous rabbit-duck optical illusion to illustrate how
        perspective shapes interpretation]</p>

    <p>This redirection is to prevent philosophers from falling into a <span class="concept">'dream-report grammatical
            illusion'</span> akin to the rabbit-duck image <span class="citation">(1953, Part II XI)</span>.</p>

    <p>Traditional positions become entrenched in seeing only one aspect of dreams. Squires terms these positions, <span
            class="concept">"Nightmariners"</span> <span class="citation">(p. 6)</span> who perceive dreams exclusively
        as sleep events, while <span class="concept">"Wideawakers"</span> see them solely as waking constructs.
        Wittgenstein radically seeks to dissolve this false dichotomy by revealing how the question itself <span
            class="quote">"Does Wittgenstein hold that dreams are not events that occurred in sleep?"</span> stems from
        grammatical misunderstanding.</p>

    <p>Building from his remarks, the grammatical illusion can be found in two components of my analysis. Firstly, the
        failure to distinguish between <span class="concept">"surface grammar"</span> and <span class="concept">"depth
            grammar"</span> <span class="citation">(1953, PI Part I §664)</span>. Surface grammar refers to how language
        appears in ordinary usage, whereas depth grammar refers to the underlying functional role of the language.
        Wittgenstein observes in <em>On Certainty</em>: <span class="quote">"Someone who, dreaming, says 'I am
            dreaming', even if he speaks audibly in doing so, is no more right than if he said in his dream 'it is
            raining', while it was in fact raining"</span> <span class="citation">(1969, §676)</span>. This demonstrates
        how the surface/depth grammar of expressions within dreams can mislead on the surface. Judgments in dreams
        appear to be making authoritative claims. Though depth grammar reveals that 'I dreamt' functions as an avowal,
        distinguishing narrative from waking reality. This reform shows how we may describe judgments in dreams as
        content without drawing evaluative conclusions of a dream's fundamental nature from them.</p>

    <p>Secondly, the illusion involves generating pseudo-problems by treating <span class="concept">"dreams"</span> as a
        stable term across different language-games. By conflating <span class="concept">"dreams"</span> with other
        first-person states which can be empirically verified, we are extracting from dreams what grammar cannot be
        supported. To resolve this Wittgenstein adopts a <span class="concept">'via negativa'</span> <span
            class="citation">(Hamilton, 2025)</span> approach to guide philosophers out of the illusion. As by pointing
        out what dreams are not, we are able to recover to the ordinary language usage that what makes out dreams more
        accurately.</p>

    <p>Applied to Descartes' dream argument, the two components of the illusion are revealed. When Descartes questions
        how the <span class="quote">"state of waking can ever be distinguished from sleep"</span> <span
            class="citation">(2013, p.17)</span>. The illusion found in Wittgenstein's remarks breaks apart the nature
        of Descartes' sceptical enquiry. His remark exemplifies the grammatical illusion of treating dreaming and
        wakefulness, as interchangeable language-games. But an approach based around how dreams differ negatively from
        waking states gives more answers to Descartes than what a positive account possibly could. As the <span
            class="concept">'via negativa'</span> approach revealed exactly what dreams are not.</p>

    <p>This analysis provides the necessary background to show how both Malcolm (1959) and Putnam (1962), despite their
        opposing positions, mistakenly impose ontological commitments which Wittgenstein explicitly avoids. Reading
        Wittgenstein's remarks as the antidote to the illusion that dreams can manifest. The neutrality in his
        therapeutic approach enables a reformulation of the debate between Malcolm (1959) and Putnam (1962), in a manner
        where ordinary language usage is championed. His neutral answer to the question is shown across his theory's
        response to the debate.</p>

    <h2>2. the malcolm-putnam debate</h2>

    <p>In Section 2, I critically analyse the Malcolm-Putnam debate, explicitly illustrating how both Malcolm and Putnam
        misinterpret Wittgenstein by imposing ontological conclusions. This discussion reinforces my view that
        Wittgenstein deliberately avoids making such claims like <span class="concept">'dreams are not events in
            sleep'</span>, in order to reform philosophy's understanding of ordinary language. The Malcolm-Putnam debate
        originates in Malcolm's <em>"Dreaming"</em> (1959) and Putnam's <em>"Dreaming and 'Depth Grammar'"</em> (1962).
        Viewed through the lens of the dream-report grammatical illusion articulated earlier from the analysis of
        Wittgenstein's remarks, we see how both Malcolm and Putnam succumb to confusions Wittgenstein's therapeutic
        method aims to dissolve.</p>

    <p>Malcolm argues that the concept of dreaming derives from dream-telling practices upon waking rather than dreaming
        itself. His argument rests on a conceptual analysis of logical grammar, particularly concerning the
        impossibility of forming judgments during sleep. Squires (forthcoming, p.6) terms Malcolm's approach <span
            class="concept">'the eliminator'</span> (forthcoming, p.6) highlighting Malcolm's view that mental activity
        during sleep is unintelligible due to the absence of verification criteria. This stance represents the
        "Wideawaker" view (Squires, forthcoming, p.6) where dreams are treated as narratives constructed upon waking
        rather than events in sleep. Malcolm explicitly states that <span class="quote">"the concept of dreaming is
            derived, not from dreaming, but from the description of dreams"</span> <span class="citation">(1959,
            p.55)</span>.</p>

    <p>Malcolm's position, while grounded in Wittgenstein's grammatical insights, differs significantly from the
        therapeutic approach. Where Malcolm yields a positive theory about dreams as not events in sleep (the Wideawaker
        view), Wittgenstein resists such ontological conclusion demonstrating the asset of the <span
            class="concept">'via negativa'</span> approach. The dream-report grammatical illusion occurs precisely when
        grammatical observations are transformed into substantive philosophical conclusion. As noted in the previous
        section, when Wittgenstein asks, <span class="quote">"Does this mean that it is nonsense ever to raise the
            question whether dreams really take place during sleep...?"</span> <span class="citation">(1953, Part II
            VII)</span>, he explicitly avoids Malcolm's definitive stance. Instead, he would respond <span
            class="quote">"It will depend on how the question is used"</span> showing a therapeutic approach that
        examines usage resisting Malcolm's ontological urges. Therefore, Malcolm extends Wittgenstein's grammatical
        analysis into stronger claims about what can and cannot occur during sleep such as judgments, leading to the
        sort of confusion that Wittgenstein sought to dissolve.</p>

    <p>Putnam (1962) challenges Malcolm's approach, stating that if the remarks are <span class="quote">"faithful to
            what Wittgenstein had in mind, then these famous arguments are bad arguments and prove nothing"</span> <span
            class="citation">(1962, p.304)</span>. Putnam claims that ordinary language usage presupposes 'something'
        occurs during sleep. This is the <span class="concept">"nightmariner"</span> view (forthcoming, p.6), where
        dreams are seen as events during sleep. This view implicitly adopts a realist metaphysical framework that treats
        dreams as objective phenomena accessible to scientific investigation. For Putnam, 'dream' functions as a natural
        kind term that can be classified according to its essential properties.</p>

    <p>Putnam's position rests on two key assumptions: first that ordinary language presupposes dreams are real
        occurrences such as events occur during sleep and second, that scientific research (such as REM studies) can
        establish a directly correlation between the phenomena of ordinary dream talk and physiological states of sleep.
    </p>

    <p>However, Putnam's position exemplifies the pseudo-problems arising in the dream-report grammatical illusions. His
        first assumption conflates ordinary and scientific discourse about dreams. In ordinary language, 'I dreamt' is a
        tool of narration to distinguish it from waking events. This does not mean that 'dream' should be treated as a
        natural kind term like Putnam suggests. Wittgenstein would reject Putnam's natural kind of approach as he warns
        against looking at language in a way where the 'essence is hidden from us' <span class="citation">(1953, PI Part
            I §92)</span> revealing his resistance to treating of ordinary language as having hidden scientific
        essences. Putnam's presupposition of continuity between ordinary scientific language exemplifies what
        Wittgenstein called the <span class="quote">"bewitchment of our understanding by the resources of our
            language"</span> <span class="citation">(1953, PI Part I, §109)</span>.</p>

    <p>This analysis reveals that the dream-report grammatical illusion underpins both Malcolm's and Putnam's
        misinterpretation of Wittgenstein. Malcolm extends Wittgenstein's grammatical investigation into substantive
        claims about what can and cannot occur during sleep. Putnam presupposes an ontological continuity between
        ordinary dream-talk and scientific discourse. Both approaches generate precisely the kind of pseudo-problems
        Wittgenstein's therapeutic method seeks to dissolve. These misinterpretations perpetuate the very confusions
        Wittgenstein aims to overcome. Wittgenstein explicitly refrains from affirming or denying dreams as events in
        sleep, highlighting instead the misreading of philosophers like Malcolm and Putnam who reach pseudo-ontological
        conclusions due to flawed grammatical analysis.</p>

    <h2>3. addressing the ontological objection</h2>

    <p>This section addresses a critical objection that Wittgenstein's therapeutic neutrality implicitly commits him to
        an ontological stance, where he does deny that dreams are events in sleep. I clarify that this objection
        misunderstands Wittgenstein's use of avowals and explicitly shows how this misunderstanding supports my thesis.
        A critical objection to Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach is that it implicitly commits him to an ontological
        stance on dreams. By rejecting both the "Nightmariner/Wideawaker" view, he might appear to deny that dreams are
        events in sleep. However, it is his focus on ordinary language use, not metaphysical commitment, that grounds
        his therapeutic method's neutrality. A critic might argue that privileging ordinary language itself smuggles in
        metaphysical assumptions. I will demonstrate why this objection misunderstands Wittgenstein's approach.</p>

    <p>Wittgenstein's therapeutic method maintains neutrality through what Hamilton calls <span
            class="concept">"authoritative avowals"</span> <span class="citation">(Hamilton, 2014, p.236)</span>. An
        avowal cannot be ruled out due to its lack of empirical verification 'I have a toothache' derives its meaning
        from its grammatical role rather than any correspondence to external events. Applied to dreams, "I dreamt"
        functions not as an empirical report but as an avowal. Wittgenstein directly addresses this avowal-like
        character of expressions when he writes that <span class="quote">"the criteria for the truth of the confession…
            resides, rather, in the special consequences which can be drawn from a confession"</span>. This
        distinguishes between the truthfulness of the dream report (the avowal) and its special consequences of
        describing the phenomena that proceeds the expression. Just as 'I have a toothache' is not a description of
        mental state but an expression of pain <span class="citation">(PI Part I, §665)</span>, "I dreamt" functions
        within a language-game of narratives. For Wittgenstein, 'toothache' does not refer to a mental event. Similarly,
        asking whether 'I dreamt' refers to events during sleep misunderstands it grammatical function, it is simply to
        place the narrative. Wittgenstein's therapeutic approach dissolve ontological questions about dreams through
        avowals rather than answering them in a way that avowals cannot.</p>

    <p>This exposes the dream-report grammatical illusion, as philosophers misinterpret the surface grammar (resembling
        empirical event descriptions) of "I dreamt" for its depth grammar (its role in narration). To see anything
        further is to be caught in an illusion like the rabbit-duck image, where philosophers project metaphysics onto
        avowals. Wittgenstein seeks philosophers to adjust their perspective on dreams' grammar focusing on use rather
        than reference to dissolve any illusions.</p>

    <p>This confusion appears in Malcolm's work when he transforms Wittgenstein's grammatical insights into ontological
        conclusions about the absence of mental activity in sleep. Malcolm's illusory error exemplifies precisely the
        kind of therapy, Wittgenstein's approach seeks to dissolve.</p>

    <p>Putnam conflates scientific experimental language-games with ordinary discourse. He mistakes an empirical
        correlation for a conceptual truth. While REM studies may answer empirical questions about brain states,
        dream-reports like how "I dreamt" function as authoritative avowals within a narrative language. Putnam's
        natural-kind approach creates precisely the pseudo-problems the dream-report grammatical illusion aims to
        dispel.</p>

    <p>The objection collapses once we recognise that Wittgenstein's method is descriptive, not prescriptive. Focusing
        on ordinary language does not uncover metaphysical truths but returns us to <span class="quote">"ordinary
            understandings"</span> <span class="citation">(Main, 2025, p. 49)</span>. Like the rabbit-duck image, the
        problem of dreams shifts when we adjust our perspective. Wittgenstein would reject the binary question of
        whether dreams are not events during sleep. His therapeutic aim is to clarify the language around dreams, not
        metaphysical pronouncements about the nature of dreams. This critical clarification explicitly reinforces my
        thesis, demonstrating that Wittgenstein's approach dissolves rather than resolves ontological questions about
        dreams. This essay argues that Wittgenstein explicitly neither affirms nor denies that dreams as events during
        sleep, he merely reveals the confusion underlying the question itself.</p>

    <h2>conclusion</h2>

    <p>Therefore, my analysis reveals that interpreting Wittgenstein as providing an answer to whether dreams are not
        events in sleep mischaracterises his aims. He aims to resolve the problem of dreams by dissolving the
        grammatical confusion philosophers fall into. This reformulating of the debate fully tackles the problem of
        philosophers like Malcolm and Putnam. His approach, synthesising 'surveyability' (<em>Übersichtlichkeit</em>)
        and Hamilton's 'via negativa', clarifies Wittgenstein's battle to return philosophy to the <span
            class="quote">"bewitchment of our understanding"</span> <span class="citation">(1953, PI Part 1,
            §109)</span> through language.</p>
